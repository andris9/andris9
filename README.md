Welcome to my Github profile ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Andris Reinman**, a software developer from Tallinn, Estonia. Most people know me as the author of [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com), the email sending library for Node.js. I'm also the author of an IMAP server called [WildDuck](https://wildduck.email/) and an MTA server [ZoneMTA](https://github.com/zone-eu/zone-mta). There are also a bunch of other code libraries, most related to â€“ you probably guessed it â€“ email.

Currently, my main project I work on is [EmailEngine](https://emailengine.app/?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=github-profile&utm_medium=github-profile), a headless email client application that hides away all the complexities of IMAP. EmailEngine allows users to access IMAP and SMTP accounts over an HTTP REST API, and it also sends webhooks whenever something happens on a tracked email account.

**[EmailEngine](https://emailengine.app/?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=github-profile&utm_medium=github-profile)**

IMAP and SMTP are hard, so let [EmailEngine](https://emailengine.app/?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=github-profile&utm_medium=github-profile) handle these for you. Run REST API calls to interact with email servers and receive webhooks for changes on tracked email accounts.
